  ## Description
  As a student in a coding bootcamp, it's important to have a README file in my Github repos to explain the project and how to use it. This README Generator I've put together will help me easily make README.md files I copy to my other repos with an organized structure.

  ## Installation
  Node.js must be installed, as well as the Inquirer node module. 
  1. While in VScode, open Terminal.
  2. If a package.json file does not exist in your project's directory, you must run `npm init -y` first to create it.
  3. Next, you will need to install the Inquirer module by typing `npm install inquirer` in the command line.

  ## Usage
  Once you have everything needed installed, the generator is ready to go!

  In the Terminal, run `node index.js`. This will initiate a series of prompts to build your new README file. Don't worry if you don't include everything at this part or if you realize you mistyped something. You can always edit the README file after it's created.

  Once you've completed the prompts, your new README file will be created in the project's directory as GeneratedREADME. Simply copy and paste it into your project's directory and rename it to whatever you like!

  ## Contribution
  I currently don't have this project open for Contribution, but if you have a great idea I'd love to here it and I would be open to allowing you to make changes to the repo.
